  # Contains some small utilities used in bb_server
  "bb_macros",
  # The transfer protocol. This is built to be read from/written to
  # by generated code, so it is not very easy to debug a packet.
  "bb_transfer",
  # The code generator. This takes json from sugarcane-data and
  # generates Rust source.
  "bb_data",
  # Common utilities. These are things like item parsers, UUIDs,
  # etc. This is anything that both the server and proxy need.
  "bb_common",
  # Generates C compatible structs, and creates C compatible enums
  # using a union and a struct.
  "bb_ffi_macros",
  # This defines a bunch of #[repr(C)] structs/functions, which are
  # used in the Wasm api. Depended on by the server and bb_plugin.
  "bb_ffi",
  # Proc macros to generate only used on the server.
  "bb_server_macros",
  # The Minecraft server. This is the first binary target. It depends
  # on bb_common, bb_ffi, bb_transfer, and bb_server_macros.
  "bb_server",
  # The proxy. This is required for any clients to connection to
  # the server. It converts the bb_transfer protocol into the
  # Minecraft protocol using generated code.
  "bb_proxy",
  # A cli tool, used to connect to a Minecraft server and validate
  # that it is sending good data (things like making sure the client
  # won't leak chunks, checks for keep alive packets, etc).
  #
  # This is not part of the server! It is only used for testing.
  "bb_cli",

  # This is a library that should be included on the plugin side.
  # It wraps all the types in `bb_ffi` with safe, easy to use types.
  # To write a plugin in another language, one would need to work
  # from `bb_ffi`, not `bb_plugin`, as this is very Rust-specific.
